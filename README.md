# Canvas-Auto-Login
a minimal script that matches to when it shows login page then logs in and redirects to canvas page. need to manually click google account though also auto closes redirect page

## Important note: only works for kids in smuhsd as idk the other canvas ones and their redirects
i'll probably make a super simple make a fallback login thing where it just clicks login but i can't do much other than that for now im lazy

## Prerequisites

its a *userscript* meaning you put this in a *userscript manager* which will execut the code for you automatically
make sure you have one of these userscript manager installed
- tampermonkey
- greasemonkey

i use tampermonkey as its the most popular and the one im most familiar with but just find one

## Installation

1. Navigate to 【index.js】（github.com/LightLordYT/Canvas-Auto-Login/blob/main/index.js）
2. Either copy the script and enter it manually in your userscript manager of choice OR press the "raw" button and tampermonkey will ask you to install it(idk abt any of the other userscript managers)
3. Your done
